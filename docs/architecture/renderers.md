# Renderers & Playback

Jamarr plays audio to three kinds of target — the local client (`<audio>` /
mobile player), UPnP/DLNA renderers, and Chromecast devices — behind **one**
playback model and **one** control API. Protocol details are isolated inside
pluggable backends.

!!! info "Code"
    `app/services/renderer/` (orchestrator, registry, contracts, persistence,
    backends) and `app/services/player/` (monitor, queue, state). Player HTTP
    routes live in `app/api/player.py` and call the orchestrator only — they do
    not import `UPnPManager`, `pychromecast`, or any protocol library.

## Layering

        │                    stream/artwork URL + token policy, auto-advance,
        │                    progress/history/scrobble, one API response shape

   RendererRegistry        ── routes a renderer_id to its backend
        ├── upnp:<udn>   → UpnpRendererBackend
        ├── cast:<uuid>  → CastRendererBackend
        └── local:<id>   → local client playback state (state-only)
```

- **Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`, `RendererOrchestrator`) owns everything
  protocol-neutral: queue, current index, progress, auto-advance, history/Last.fm,
  stream-token policy, and the normalised player state persisted to the DB.
- **Backends** (`upnp_backend.py`, `cast_backend.py`) translate
  play/pause/resume/stop/seek/volume/status into protocol calls and emit a
  normalised `RendererStatus`. They hide native IDs, status strings, connection
  lifecycle, and libraries.
- **Registry** (`registry.py`, `RendererRegistry`) holds backend instances keyed
  by `kind`, parses renderer IDs, and merges discovery across backends.

## Canonical renderer identity

Every renderer has a backend-agnostic ID:

```
renderer_id = "{kind}:{native_id}"
```

| kind | example | native_id |
|---|---|---|
| `upnp` | `upnp:uuid:abcd-…` | UPnP UDN |
| `cast` | `cast:8f1c…` | Cast device UUID |
| `local` | `local:web-client-id` | per-client ID |

Helpers `make_renderer_id` / `split_renderer_id` (in `contracts`) format and
parse these. The legacy `udn` field is still accepted on input and persisted for
backwards compatibility, but new code passes `renderer_id` + `kind`. See
[ADR-0002](decisions/0002-renderer-orchestration.md).

## Contracts

`contracts.py` defines protocol-neutral dataclasses that everything above the
backend speaks in:

- **`RendererCapabilities`** — `can_play/pause/stop/seek/set_volume/mute`,
  `can_next_previous`, `reports_progress`, `supports_events`, `supported_mime_types`, …
- **`RendererDevice`** — `renderer_id`, `kind`, `native_id`, `name`, `ip`,
  `manufacturer`, `model_name`, `cast_type`, `discovered_by`, `capabilities`,
  `available`, group info.
- **`RendererStatus`** — normalised `state` (`PLAYING`/`PAUSED`/`STOPPED`/
  `BUFFERING`/`IDLE`/`UNKNOWN`), `position_seconds`, `duration_seconds`,
  `volume_percent`, `current_track_id`, `ended`.
- **`PlaybackContext`** — `base_url`, `user_id`, `username`, `token_ttl_seconds`.
- **`RendererBackend`** (Protocol) — the interface every backend implements;
  optional **`SupportsStatusEvents`** for callback-driven protocols.

The orchestrator does not care whether a `RendererStatus` came from polling
(UPnP) or media-controller callbacks (Cast).

## Status & auto-advance

- UPnP backend runs a **poll loop** (`app/services/player/monitor.py`) and emits
  `RendererStatus`.
- Cast backend subscribes to `pychromecast` media-controller **callbacks**;
  callbacks are dispatched back onto the asyncio loop before mutating state.
- The orchestrator normalises status, updates progress/volume, detects
  track-end (`ended=True`, or Cast `IDLE` after `PLAYING`), and advances the
  queue exactly once. A short grace period after `play_track()` suppresses the
  transient `IDLE` during Cast load so it doesn't false-advance.

## Stream-token policy

Cast receivers parse the stream URL once and never re-auth, so the default 300 s
token is too short for a long track. The orchestrator (`token_policy.py`) issues
a longer, duration-aware TTL for `kind == "cast"`:

```python
min(CAST_STREAM_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS, max(1800, duration_seconds * 2))   # default cap 86400
```

Tokens stay bound to `track_id`, so scope is narrow even with a long TTL. Full
rationale and the trade-offs: [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-cast-stream-token-policy.md).

## Two Cast control paths

| Path | Discovers | Controls | Where the server is | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Server-driven** | server (mDNS) | server (`pychromecast`) | same LAN as Cast devices | home server / NAS / Pi |
| **Device-direct** | Android (Cast SDK) | Android | anywhere, incl. public | VPS / remote server |

Both paths: the Cast device fetches the stream URL from the server over HTTP and
plays via the Default Media Receiver (no custom receiver app). Device-direct Cast
pins the server's active renderer to `local:<clientId>` and reports
queue/progress/index through the normal local-client path, so history and
scrobbling behave like Android device-UPnP. See
[ADR-0004](decisions/0004-cast-dual-control-path.md) and the
[Android client](../clients/android.md).

## Deployment notes

- Docker needs `network_mode: "host"` for both UPnP SSDP and Cast mDNS.
- Cast playback does **not** transcode in v1; unsupported codecs/containers fail
  on the receiver. The Default Media Receiver covers common formats.
- Device-direct Cast requires Google Play Services — de-Googled Android can still
  use server-driven Cast.

## History

This subsystem replaced a design where `app/api/player.py` called the
`UPnPManager` singleton directly. The refactor was delivered in phases (baseline
characterization → unified backend contract → server Cast → device Cast → web
UI → hardening), each keeping local + UPnP playback working. The
backend/device-split and capability model take inspiration from Music Assistant's
provider architecture (reference only, not a dependency).
